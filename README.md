  <P>
 This simple analysis is about the best method of acquiring the funestus larval in their habitation. This analysis done from the few different type of habitat from the different sampling area around KILOMBERO RIVER VALLEY during the continuation of climate buzz project in 2024. This analysis was doing from different habitat type like: - stream/river, ditch, swamp, stream pool, ditch, brick or sand pit, spring-fed well, ground pool and manmade construction.
In this analysis we have two similar Deeping method were used these I mention bellow.<br>
<center><b>1. Deep sided bucket/dipper dipping method.<br>
2. Upper sided bucket/dipper dipping method.</b></center>
<h2><b><center><u> 1.DEEP SIDED BUCKET/DIPPER DIPPING METHOD.</u></center></b></h2>
This is the first analysis method were used during observation at the field area (larval habitation) in this procedure the field worker should be place the bucket/dipper at the interior part of the habitat. (ndoo au dipa ya kikombe yapaswa kuzamishwa katika kingo za zalia ndan Zaidi kulingana na kina na ukubwa wa zalia. Mchotaji yambidi afanye kama kukwangua chini katika kingo za zalia ambapo yaaminika Zaidi kwa uwepo wa viluilui wa funestus ambao hupeendelea kujishikiza katika kingo za maji katika zalia. Kisha atainua ndoo/dipa kwaajili ya kuchukua sampuli za viluilui waliopatikana. Utarudia mara kadhaa kutokana na iddi ya dipa unazotaka kufanya) this is the explanation of how deep sided bucket/dipper dipping method was done.
<h2><b><center><u>2. UPPER SIDED BUCKET/DIPPER DIPPING METHOD.</u></center></b></h2>
This is the second and final analysis method were used during observation at the field area (larval habitation) in this method the field worker should be placed the bucket/dipper at the upper part of the habitat. (ndoo au dip ya kikombe yapaswa kuchota viluilui pasi na kuzamishwa chini Zaidi ktika kingo za zalia kulingana na ukubwa na kina cha zalia. Atafanya hivyo mara kadhaa kutokana na idad ya dipa anazohitaji mchotaji.) thisis the simple explanation on what a field
worker should do in this method.

 The common purpose is to identify the behavior of funestus larval in their habitat and the best way or method of acquiring sample. Other minor purpose is: -<br>
 To observe the common habitat type which funestus larval are being appear.<br>
 To observe the best environment/climatic condition that is more friendly for their survival.<br>
 The observation of study.<br>
